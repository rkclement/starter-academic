abstract: This article introduces using Customer Journey Maps (CJM) in libraries and the role mapping can play in visualizing the user's journey in order to help library staff better understand and optimize the user's experience. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the importance and relevance of the mapping process for any library user experience. The article will also review findings from the Reed College Library use of mapping discovered during our own review of services and resource usage.
