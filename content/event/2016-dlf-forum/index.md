abstract: Middlebury College is engaged in a collaborative effort between librarians, ITS, and faculty to define, plan, and implement a digital preservation and access system that answers the varied needs across multiple disciplines. We discussed the challenges, strategies, and insights encountered throughout this process, including our participation in [DLFâ€™s eResearch Network](https://www.diglib.org/opportunities/e-research-network/). [Our slides](https://osf.io/sb6pk/) are available, as well.
