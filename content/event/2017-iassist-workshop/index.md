  *A pre-conference workshop.*

  Successful outreach on topics such as working with and managing research data can be challenging when teaching novice users. Participants in this workshop  learned about v 1.0 (2015) and 2.0 (2016) of a multi-day Data Bootcamp for novice data users in the humanities and social sciences, held at Middlebury College. These bootcamps covered topics such as managing, cleaning, and documenting data, as well as data visualization, mapping, and working with textual data.

  In addition to discussion about what worked for Middlebury, participants worked together to determine audience needs, learning objectives, and tools. Workshop ideas that developed focused on active learning methods and free and/or open-source tools and data to increase accessibility. Participants were also able to access and share workshop materials from an Open Science Framework project.
