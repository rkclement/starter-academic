abstract: In this talk, we discussed the development of the conference we developed as started as students at University of Michigan's School of Information in the spring of 2012, Quasi-Con. Quasi-Con was/is a hybrid unconference and more traditional conference. You can read more about the development of Quasi-Con in the Hack Library School post we wrote about it, ["How to Hack the Academic Conference"](https://hacklibraryschool.com/2012/03/13/how-to-hack-the-academic-conference/). We discussed the impetus behind this DIY conference through the lens of [the communities of practice framework](http://wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/).
